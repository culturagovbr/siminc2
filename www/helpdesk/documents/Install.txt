A) To install PHP Support Tickets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
01. Copy all files to a sub directory within your web site.
02. Run the file install/index.php and fill up the form correctly
03. Make sure you add the appropriate security to the config.inc.php file. Chmod etc.
04. Styles may be modified by editing /css/style.css and /css/style_global.css.
05. Aspects of the graphical interface can be modified by editing the files found
    under /classes/GUI

B) Upgrade a previous version
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In the /sql folder you will find a migration script for 1.9 to 2.2. This was
   needed because of the large differences between the 2 database layouts. For
   migrations between further versions, the tables are essentially the same,
   except for table names, so we except the change won't be difficult to make
   by hand. If you are having troubles, let us know and we will write a new
   script for these migrations. Tnis latest version of the script is yet
   untested. You are welcome to give us some feedback on it, should you need it

C) Using the File Upload
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE : In version 2, all file upload path and filetype information are stored in
root/classes/static/static.FormHandler.php.

1.	This can be quite complicated to set up and may involve you having to
	check your PHP.ini file.
2.	Firstly in the config make sure that ALLOWATTACHMENTS is set to TRUE.
	This will place the form on the User and Admin side underneath the
	response box, and also allow the verification of the upload.
3.	Set the MAXFILE size this has to be in BYTES - here I would also check
	your PHP.ini file to make sure that firstly you allow file uploads and
	secondly make sure that the Max File Size is set high enough for your
	desires. I wouldnt allow people to upload files too big though! also
	check that your TMP UPLOAD folder is set.
4.	Next you must set the paths to your upload folder. The first UPLOADPATH
	must be the absolute path on the server i.e. C:/wwwroot/etc... This
	folder also must be writable by your webusers, otherwise I cannot dump
	the files into that. The RELATIVEPATH is used to download the items and
	must point to the upload folder on the web side i.e.
	http://www.yourdomain.com/etc....
5.	File types; the first array houses some common MIME file types and one
	extension for each. This is important that you dont list all the common
	extensions as this is how I name the file.
6.	ALLOWEDTYPES indicates what files types you would like the customers to
	upload. Simply copy the MIME type into the string, making sure you
	enclose it with quotes and they are correctly coma seperated. Scan the
	internet for MIME types that you want to include.

D) Additional Notes relevant to version 2.2

ABOUT CREATING USERS:

Self-registration is on by default, but only at the Client level. Only Admins
can create Moderators and Admins, but they can also create regular client users.

There is no more Admin subfolder, the user's privileges are detected during the login
procedure, and the GUI is updated accordingly, offering different menus for the
different admin levels.

I hope the above is all clear if you have any problems understanding anything

donated first if you want support!
